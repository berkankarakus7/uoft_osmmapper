# Mapper - A Google Maps Clone for Navigation

![Mapper Logo](path/to/logo.png)

## Overview

Welcome to **Mapper**, a Geographic Information System (GIS) application designed to be a clone of Google Maps. This project was developed by three Computer Engineering students at the University of Toronto. Our aim was to create a robust navigation tool using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database and implement advanced optimization algorithms to enhance route planning and navigation.

## Features

- **Real-Time Navigation**: Provides accurate turn-by-turn directions.
- **Traffic Updates**: Real-time traffic conditions to optimize routes.
- **Search and Discover**: Easily find locations, businesses, and landmarks.
- **Multiple Transport Modes**: Supports routes for driving, biking, walking, and public transport.
- **Customizable Maps**: Different map styles, including satellite and terrain views.
- **Offline Maps**: Download and use maps offline.
- **Route History**: Save and review previously taken routes.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Implemented Dijkstra's, A* algorithm, and two-opt perturbation to optimize routes and travel time.
- **Travelling Salesman Problem**: Solved using the app's features.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Libraries**:
  - C++ Standard Library
  - GTK for the user interface
- **Database**: OpenStreetMap (OSM)
- **Algorithms**:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A* Algorithm
  - Two-Opt Perturbation

## Installation

To run Mapper locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mapper.git
   cd mapper
